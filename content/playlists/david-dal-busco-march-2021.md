# Deafheaven

Their black metal played in major cord is just epic! Perfect to write a zillion lines of code. I attended three of their live shows, hopefully one day at least a fourth one ðŸ¤ž. Likely my favorite band these last 10 years and by far.

# EZ3kiel

A friend of mine gave me the "Lux" album of EZ3kiel for my birthday. I did not know them before and, the least we can say, it was a great present.

# Neurosis

I wish I could afford the Neurosis vinyl "A sun that never sets". The song "Stones from the sky" is powerful.
