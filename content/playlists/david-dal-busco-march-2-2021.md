# Mogwai

Since I started to get vinyl, I preorder those of bands I like while restraining me to listen to anything on Spotify before actually getting the physical material.  

That's why I am quite excited to have received today both Mogwai and Cult Of Luna new albums ðŸ¥³.

# Cult Of Luna

I saw them live at the [Rock Altitude](https://www.rockaltitude.ch/) back in 2013. The same evening as Deftones was performing too. That was such a cool events. Such a cool festival.
