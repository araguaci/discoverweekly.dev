# La Luz

Discovering the first album of La Luz changed my mind about surf rock. I used to thought it all sounded like "Surfin USA" from the Beach Boys but, it is so much more than that. I became a real fan of that kind of music and, from La Luz. I attended their last gig in Bern, got a t-shirt, some EPs and even learned some of their songs on the guitar ðŸŽ¸.

# Daikaiju

One of my last discoveries. The cover of the "Phase 2" got my interest, I stayed for the music.

# The Volcanos

I literally bought The Volcanos vinyl last Saturday. It sounds a bit more standard surf rock than two previous tips.

# La Femme

Not sure I can really classify La Femme as surf rock but, I notice some similarities in their excellent album "Psycho Tropical Berlin".

# Duck Duck Grey Duck

When I attended the La Luz concert, Duck Duck Grey Duck did the opening. I already heard them on the radio and their performance confirmed their nice sound. Also a few weeks later I started my side project [DeckDeckGo](https://deckdeckgo.com), maybe somewhere there is a link between both names ðŸ˜‰.
