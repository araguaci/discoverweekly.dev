# Closet Disco Queen

Today they announced the line-up of the [Palp festival](https://palpfestival.ch/) which probably will be one of the few festivals of the summer. I went through the announcement and was pleased to notice Closed Disco Queen, from La Chaux-de-Fonds, not faraway from my home region. I think they will play at the special Raclette event ðŸ§€.

# Toundra

Toundra is also supposed to perform at the festival. I like their post rock, they have got some great tunes. It would be also cool to attend their gig, well actually, right now, to speak frankly, to attend any gig actually ðŸ˜….

# L'Ã©clair

Unlike the to above, l'Ã©clair, from Geneva I think, is probably more funky than rock, still instrumental though and as great too.
