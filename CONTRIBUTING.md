A playlist is a post written in Markdown. It contains `meta` section, which describe the author, and the `content` itself, the playlist.

## Table of contents

- [Meta](#meta)

## Meta

The meta information are displayed on the site, to present the author of the playlist, but also injected in the `<head/>` of the generated page.

If you develop further the site, these are referenced as `frontmatter`.

It is recommended to submit at least three music tips but, you can add less or more. Each of these contain a `title`, a small `description` and a link to `Youtube` or `Spotify`.

The `title`, `description` and a music material pro playlist are mandatory âœ….

```
# Deafheaven

Their black metal in major cord is epic! Perfect to write a zillion lines of code ðŸ˜‰.
